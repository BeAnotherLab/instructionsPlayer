Sound file player for the Machine to Be Another


Simple sound-file player for adding instructions on Headphones 
during The Machine to Be Another performances.

Currently it accepts OSC input for controlling sound-files through
a smartphone. The current OSC controller is built on Control developed 
by Charlie-Roberts and published under a GPL license.

Check his website http://charlie-roberts.com/Control/ for info on how to upload
the Machine to Be Another's interface. The interface can be found at:

/instructionsPlayer/control/theMachineButtons.js

or

http:/marte.me/osc/theMachineButtons.js



TODO

Add OSC output so that toggles are turned off on the Control App.

Decide whether there should be an option to stop sounds.

Merge with TheMachineToBeAnother software.
